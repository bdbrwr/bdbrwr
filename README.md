## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Bart and I've always "scripted" some stuff to help make my life easier. 
You'll either see me making tools that help to build tools, or more likely, tools that'll fit into gaming. 

I've always had the possibility to translate between business and IT, now I can actually build some of my own stuff.
